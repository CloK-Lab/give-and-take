# Working on Give and take

This is a CloK learning and research project toward a verified decentralized
superintelligence (DSI) system. Its purpose is to build formal models,
specifications, and executable code in Lean for human-agent coordination and
physical and computational resource allocation, supporting the construction,
verification, and improvement of infrastructure. Agent protocols, payments,
tokenized assets, incentives, and safety are parts of that system.

- Implement the project's own chain, stablecoin mechanisms, wallets, payment
  rules, and agent protocols natively in Lean. External infrastructure is
  reference material only; do not build the runtime on external chains, issued
  stablecoins, hosted payment services, or their SDKs. Keep reference probes
  separate from project execution and record the actual implementation status.
- Retain executable Lean models of external infrastructure as reference cases
  alongside the native implementation. Compare selected compositions through
  explicit common specifications and observation mappings. Distinguish shared
  safety properties, refinement, and behavioral equivalence; model proofs do
  not by themselves establish conformance of deployed external systems.
- Prioritize learning: explain one small question clearly before adding topics.
  Use worked examples in the relevant subsections to explain modeling choices.
  Keep reader navigation small, leave undeveloped topics as drafts, and avoid
  unnecessary frameworks, checklists, and duplicate explanations.
- Open each note with a concise academic statement of its subject, scope, and
  actual modeling or implementation work. Cite the main reference documents
  where relevant. Keep writing advice, learning methods, project positioning, and
  promises about future work in contributor documentation, not reader-facing prose.
  End notes when the subject is explained; do not append generic outlook or
  open-question sections.
- State the Lean-native positioning once in the overview introduction. Do not
  repeat it in note headings, captions, alt text, or introductory filler. Name
  sections for their subject (for example, "Spending policy", not "In Lean").
  Preserve actual project names, source filenames, and code syntax.
- Use English for repository documentation and code comments; converse with the
  user in their preferred language.
- Read README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and the guide for the case being changed.
- Keep definitions, specifications, execution, and verification separate.
  The demo and proofs must refer to the same executable Lean definitions.
- Follow the source layout in README.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md. Foundation
  has no dependencies on other project layers; Reference and Native do not
  depend on each other or Cases. Keep cross-layer fixtures in Cases and future
  correspondence proofs in Comparisons. Website navigation is independent of
  source paths; preserve note slugs when moving modules.
- Add concrete cases before introducing general frameworks. Do not create empty
  modules for planned features or describe reading notes as implementations.
- Preserve explicit units, assumptions, source versions, and proof boundaries.
  Do not conflate protocol execution, service quality, economic incentives,
  external asset backing, or chain settlement.
- Do not introduce admitted proofs, custom axioms, or native evaluation axioms.
  Audit new public theorems in scripts/Audit.lean.
- Run lake build, lake exe demo, and lake env lean scripts/Audit.lean.
- Keep case notes beside their Lean source as Note.mdx and use source excerpts
  instead of copying definitions or proofs. Follow docs/README.md and clok.json.
- For documentation changes, run npm run build and inspect the affected pages.
  Preserve the shared CloK documentation format and notebook visual conventions.
- Follow docs/DIAGRAMS.md for diagrams. The approved native-system.svg sets the
  isometric geometry, semantic colors, typography, and connector conventions.
- Keep generated build files, credentials, and local runtime data out of Git.
